<!--
    Important things to note:
        All current blocks:
            styles -> for including css made for a page, each page has their own css along with base.css for organization
                      can also put js files there if none of the functions directly interact with the page (so no changing innerHTML or HTML elements in general)
            onload -> in case you need to load some js as the page loads, make sure to include the <script> html section in the content block, or at least any block that is in the body
                          refer to receive-story.html for an example, right at the start of the content block
            page -> for stylistic purposes, allows you to add a custom title to the top of the page
            navbuttons -> to organize buttons that can be used to navigate the site, they will all be aligned at the top right of the page
            content -> the actual content of the body, where things happen
